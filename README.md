# Salary Calculator

## Description

This is a Salary calculator app that takes in an employee first and last name, ID Number, Job Title and Annual Salary. It lays out those inputs in a table that adds up and displays the total monthly costs based on what was input. If the total monthly amount goes over $20,000.00 it alerts you by turning the background red for that figure.
