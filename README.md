# JS Salary Calculator

## Description

This is a Salary calculator app that takes in an employee first and last name, ID Number, Job Title and Annual Salary. It lays out those inputs in a table that adds up and displays the total monthly costs based on what was input. If the total monthly amount goes over $20,000.00 it alerts you by turning the background red for that figure.

## Task List

[] Build the form, table, calculation area in html
[] Get the form to work (adds new table row)
[] Get the delete button to work (removes row)
[] Get the salary calculation to work (math)
[] Update salary calculation based on number (red > $20K)
[] Stretch: Get the calculation to work on delete too
